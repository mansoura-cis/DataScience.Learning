    "\n",
    "- Scalability => currently handles small datasets, uses sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Most of Algorithms Handles small datasets, If  Big Data => Sampling or Binning\n",

    "- Handling different attribute types => mostly numerical\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discovering clusters with arbitrary shape =>  currently mostly spherical\n",

    "- Domain knowledge  & input parameters =>  clusters & clustering results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling noisy data => currently sensitive to noise\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incremental clustering & insensitivity to input order => new data requires re-computing clusters from scratch – sensitive to order\n",

    "- Handling high-dimensionality data => mostly low Dimensionality\n",

    "- Constraint-based clustering => little support for domain constraints\n",

    "### Methods on Practical\n",
    "- Partitioning based Methods \n",
    "    - Find mutually exclusive clusters of spherical shape\n",
    "    - Distance-based\n",
    "    - May use mean or medoid to represent cluster center\n",
    "        - Examples K-Mean , K-medoid\n",
    "        - medoids : are representative objects of a data set or a cluster with a data set whose average dissimilarity to all the objects in the cluster is minimal. Medoids are similar in concept to means or centroids, but medoids are always members of the data set.\n",
    "    - Effective for small- to medium-size data sets\n",

    "- hierarchical methods\n",
    "    - Clustering is hierarchy involving multiple levels \n",
    "    - Cannot correct erroneous merges/splits\n",
    "    - May consider object “linkages”\n",
    "\n",

    "- The hierarchical starts from small clusters subsets then check if the other objects and the inside can be in one cluster\n",
